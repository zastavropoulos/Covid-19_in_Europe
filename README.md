# Studing the pandemic
### What do the numbers have to say about Covid-19 in Europe?

This project aims to better understand the effects of the pandemic of Covid-19 in Europe. We'll make a full analysis of the data starting from exploring and cleaning it to analyzing and coming up with conclusions. 

The key factors we have to consider are
* The relationship between cases and deaths.
* What percentage of people that are infected need hospitalization?
* What percentage of those people need ICU?
* How do tests affect the number of cases?

First I'll like to start with some assumptions about the answers to the questions above. Let's start from the bottom. I think that it is logical to say that as the number of tests increases so does the number of reported cases. More cases mean more people need to go to the hospital, and also some of them will need ICU. So I expect that with an increase in new cases we'll see more hospitalizations. Finally, I also think that as cases increase we'll have more and more deaths. 

The next step is to explore and analyze the data. The original dataset can be found [here](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-testing).

The above image is the final result of the data cleaning process.

Stay tuned for the analysis process.
